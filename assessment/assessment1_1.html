    <h2 style="color: aqua;">CLOWN</h2>
    <p style="color: brown;">Dance is an art form consisting of sequences of body movements with aesthetic and
         often symbolic value, either improvised or purposefully selected.</p>
         <p style="color: blue;">Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements or
          by its historical period or place of origin. Dance is typically performed with
         musical accompaniment, and sometimes with the dancer simultaneously using a musical
          instrument themselves.</p>
