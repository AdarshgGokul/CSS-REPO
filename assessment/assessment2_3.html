    <h1>Naruto</h1>
    <p>
        Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.
         It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his
          peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told 
          in two partsâ€”the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens.
          </p>
          <p class="ad">
           The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned 
           Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year,
           and Naruto (1997).
